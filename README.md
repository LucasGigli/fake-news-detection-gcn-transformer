<h1 align="center">ðŸ“° Fake News Detection with GCN-Transformer</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>A hybrid model for identifying misinformation through content and user network structure.</em><br>
  <strong>Based on my MSc Thesis in Data Analytics (2025)</strong>

## Why This Project would benefit?

Fake news isn't just about the text â€” it's about <strong>how it spreads</strong>.  
Traditional models focus only on content. This model captures both:
- Textual meaning (via BERT + Transformer)
- Social structure (via GCN on user-tweet graphs)

## Key Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **BERT**         | Encodes tweet text into semantic embeddings |
| **Cosine Similarity** | Builds graph edges based on similarity |
| **GCN**          | Learns from the graph structure (user-post links) |
| **Transformer**  | Captures long-range, cross-node dependencies |

---

## Results

 **97% Recall on Fake Labels**  
 **Outperforms** SVM, XGBoost, and standalone GCN  
 Handles **imbalanced data** and misinformation propagation
