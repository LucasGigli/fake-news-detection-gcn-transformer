<h1 align="center">ðŸ“° Fake News Detection with GCN-Transformer</h1>

<p align="center">
  <em>A hybrid model for identifying misinformation through content and user network structure.</em><br>
  <strong>Based on my MSc Thesis in Data Analytics (2025)</strong>

## Why This Project would benefit?

Fake news isn't just about the text â€” it's about <strong>how it spreads</strong>.  
Traditional models focus only on content. This model captures both:
- Textual meaning (via BERT + Transformer)
- Social structure (via GCN on user-tweet graphs)

## Key Components

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **BERT**         | Encodes tweet text into semantic embeddings |
| **Cosine Similarity** | Builds graph edges based on similarity |
| **GCN**          | Learns from the graph structure (user-post links) |
| **Transformer**  | Captures long-range, cross-node dependencies |

---

## Results

 **97% Recall on Fake Labels**  
 **Outperforms** SVM, XGBoost, and standalone GCN  
 Handles **imbalanced data** and misinformation propagation

##  Repository Contents

 `thesis.pdf` â€“ Full MSc research document  
 `notebook.ipynb` â€“ Code demo (in progress)  
 `summary.pdf` â€“ One-page summary (optional)

---

##  Dataset

Uses the open-source **Twitter 15/16** datasets  
Includes real/false labels, tweet content, and user interactions

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add Streamlit or Gradio demo
- Integrate real-time tweet input and prediction
- Improve visualizations of graph structure
